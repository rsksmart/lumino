# Get your own RIF Lumino node up and running on Ubuntu

## Prerequisites

1. Access to a synced RSK node. You can do this in a variety of ways:
	1. Run your own node on Testnet or Mainnet, see [Node (RSKj): Install](https://developers.rsk.co/rsk/node/install/).
	2. Compile and run a RSK node locally, see [Node (RSKj): Contribute](https://developers.rsk.co/rsk/node/contribute/).
2. An RSK account with an RBTC balance NOT lower than 0.001 RBTC.
3. Ubuntu 18.04+.

## Install required libraries/software

### 1. Install Python 3.7

Update your packages and install pre-requisites by executing:

```shell script
sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common
```

Add deadsnakes PPA to your sources list:

```shell script
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
```

Once the repository is enabled, install Python 3.7:

```shell script
sudo apt install python3.7
```

### 2. Install Python 3.7-dev

If you didn't update your local APT repository, execute:

```shell script
sudo apt update
```

To install python 3.7-dev run the following command:

```shell script
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev python3.7-dev
```

### 3. Install `pip`

If you didn't update your local APT repository, execute:

```shell script
sudo apt update
```

Install `pip3` by executing:

```shell script
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

### 4. Install `virtualenv`

If you didn't update your local APT repository, execute:

```shell script
sudo apt update
```

Install `virtualenv` by executing:

```shell script
sudo apt-get install virtualenv
```

### 5. Install Lumino Invoicing dependencies

Lumino includes a billing that is based on the Lighting Network invoicing feature. In order to install Lumino, the following dependencies are required:

```shell script
sudo apt install libsecp256k1-dev

sudo apt-get install libssl-dev build-essential automake pkg-config libtool libffi-dev libgmp-dev libyaml-cpp-dev
```

## Build RIF Lumino from code

### 1. Get the code

Get the code from [the Github page](https://github.com/rsksmart/lumino/). You can either clone the repo or get the compressed version from the [releases page](https://github.com/rsksmart/lumino/releases). 

Let's call your local path in which the code resides `$RIF_LUMINO_PATH`.

### 2. Create an environment

You'll only need to create a python virtual environment for RIF Lumino once. 

Execute the following command:

```shell script
virtualenv -p <PATH_TO_PYTHON3.7> clientEnv
```

**Note:**

Replace `<PATH_TO_PYTHON3.7>` with the path where Python3.7 is installed in your system. In the case of Ubuntu OS, this is usually `/usr/bin/python3.7`.

You can verify your path to Python3.7 by executing:
```shell script
which python3
```

### 3. Activate the environment
Activate the python virtual environment by executing the following command:

```shell script
source clientEnv/bin/activate
```

Check if the Python version is correct inside the virtual environment by running:

```shell script
python --version
```

This command should output version 3.7.x.

### 4. Install RIF Lumino requirements in your environment

Inside the virtual environment run the following command (this could take a few minutes):

```shell script
pip install -r requirements.txt -c constraints.txt -e .
```

Run the Lumino setup with the following command:

```shell script
python setup.py develop
```

## Start your RIF Lumino Node

1. Go to `$RIF_LUMINO_PATH`.
2. If you haven't executed it before, run `source clientEnv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment.
3. Run the following command to start Lumino:
    
    ```shell script
    lumino
        --keystore-path $KEYSTORE_PATH
        --network-id 33
        --eth-rpc-endpoint $RSK_NODE_URL
        --environment-type development
        --tokennetwork-registry-contract-address $TOKENNETWORK_REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
        --secret-registry-contract-address $SECRET_REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
        --endpoint-registry-contract-address $ENDPOINT_REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
        --no-sync-check
        --api-address 127.0.0.1:5001
        --rnsdomain $YOUR_RNS_DOMAIN
        --discoverable # if this flag is present, then your node will be registered on Lumino Explorer
        --hub-mode # if this flag is present, then your node will run in HUB mode
    ```

    | `$KEYSTORE_PATH`                          | The path to your keystore folder.                                                                                                       |
    | `network-id`                              | The blockchain network ID you're connecting to. This must match the RSK node you're connecting to. `33` is regtest.                     |
    | `$RSK_NODE_URL`                           | URL of the RSK node to connect to (`http://URL:PORT`). If you're running a local node, this will typically be `http://localhost:4444/`. |
    | `environment-type`                        | You will need this set to `development` in order to use custom blockchain and contract addresses.                                       |
    | `$TOKENNETWORK_REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` | Address for the token registry contract deployed (view contracts table).                                                                |
    | `$SECRET_REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`       | Address for the secret registry contract deployed (view contracts table).                                                               |
    | `$ENDPOINT_REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`     | Address for the endpoint registry contract deployed (view contracts table).                                                             |
    | `no-sync-check`                           | This will allow you to bypass checking that the node is synchronized against etherscan.                                                 |
    | `$YOUR_RNS_DOMAIN`                        | You can supply the RNS address associated with your RSK node address, e.g. `--rnsdomain=lumino.rsk.co`                                 |

    More configuration options can be found by browsing the code.

### Contract addresses for each network

Go to [the Lumino Github repo](https://github.com/rsksmart/lumino) for the latest addresses of the contracts.

You can also use your own contract addresses if you're connecting to a local blockchain for development or testing purposes.
